This is an index of Proof of Concepts for the next generation of compliance tooling

[OSLiLi](https://github.com/oscarvalenzuelab/oslili) - An Open Source License Identification Library that uses Machine Learning (scikit-learn), and regular expresions to identify licenses.

[OSLiLi Cli](https://github.com/oscarvalenzuelab/OSLiLi-cli) [](https://github.com/oscarvalenzuelab/oslili-flask) \- A terminal CLI for OSLiLi

[Kotaix Binary Scanner](https://github.com/oscarvalenzuelab/kotaix) - A "Warp Speed" code scanner that use Inferentia to generate a list of OSS packages. It can identify OSS components on binary files using Binary Static Analysis.

[BotSniffer](https://github.com/oscarvalenzuelab/botsniffer) - A tool to detect AI written code using Humman Pattern (Stupidity Coefficient) and Feature Extraction instead of snippet matching and code plagiarism.

[Namonica](https://github.com/oscarvalenzuelab/namonica) - A tool that uses Machine Learning and Proximity (similarity/dissimilarity) to infer OSS package names from a list of strings.
